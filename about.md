Hello people!

</p>
I am **Rohan Jaswal**, a Computer Science and Engineering student at [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur](http://nith.ac.in). I am presently in my second year. 

I love tweaking with computers, coding and learning new things. I am interested in Web development, Operating Systems, and Mobile applications. I love learning about new things and like to share what I learn with as many people I can. It makes my learning more interesting.

Apart from this, I love to travel and visit new places. I am Quoran and love to read about Technology, Economy, Sports and many other things on Quora. Besides this, I love to watch Nolan movies.
